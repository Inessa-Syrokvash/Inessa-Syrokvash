### - About -:
Hi! My name is Inessa! I am a frontend developer. I am passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites. My skill set includes using advanced technologies such as HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript to create a unique and attractive user interface. I have also mastered Bootstrap, which allows me to quickly and efficiently to develop responsive websites. I'm creative and attentive to detail, so I often use animation to create effects that bring my work to life. I love to do the little things, to perfect everything. I am currently studying React in depth to expand my skills and to create more complex web applications. I would be happy to provide my services and take part in interesting projects!
